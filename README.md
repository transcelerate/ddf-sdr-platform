# Overview

 This repository contains Terraform IaC code and configuration for Deploying SDR Infrastructure resources to Microsoft Azure Platform.

 Terraform : Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code tool that greatly reduces the amount of time needed to implement and scale the infrastructure. It is provider agnostic.

 The folder structure of the IaC code is shown below.

- modules - Contains code for all the resources which can be reusable. 
- main.tf - Contains modules for all the resources which can be reusable.
- variables.tf - Contains the variables for all the modules/resources.

## Modules

This folder contains all the modularized code for the resources listed below.

## main.tf

- This file contains the resource configuration code. This file invokes the modules for the specific resources to be deployed on the Microsoft Azure Platform.
- Single module can be called multiple times to create the same set of resources with different naming conventions and configurations.

## Variables.tf

- Variables that are repeated / parameterized / environment specific, can be declared in variables.tf.

# Deployment Process

**Important Note:** Refer to the **[DDF SDR Azure Platform Setup and Deployment Guide](documents/ddf-sdr-azure-platform-setup-and-deployment-guide-v3.0.pdf)** and **[DDF SDR Azure Platform Design and Implementation Guide](documents/ddf-sdr-azure-platform-design-and-implementation-v2.0.pdf)** documents before following the below steps. 

## Instructional Vidoes

Several videos have been created to show steps a user would need to go through to provision a new instance of the SDR in their organization's local Azure environment.

## Pre-Requisites

- Service principal in Azure AD with contributor access to Azure Subscription and user administrator access to Azure AD.

## Secrets

- The secrets listed below must be created on Github. The secrets will be fetched and replaced in the main.yml and variables.tf files during the deployment action.

### main.yml Secret Variables

Terraform will use these secret values (from GitHub Secrets) to login to the Microsoft Azure Platform and deploy the resources according to the configuration defined in the IaC code.

    - AZURE_SP              : The Service Principal details in JSON format.
    Service Principal Sample JSON :
    {
    "clientId": "***Client-Id***",
    "clientSecret": "***Client-Secret***",
    "subscriptionId": "***SusbscriptionId***",
    "tenantId": "***TenantID***",
    "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
    "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
    "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
    "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
    "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
    "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
    }
    - AZURE_RESOURCEGROUP   : The name of the Resource Group that contains the storage account.
    - AZURE_STORAGEACCOUNT  : The Storage Account name
    - AZURE_CONTAINERNAME   : The name of the blob container wherein the Terraform State file will be stored.
    - AZURE_CLIENT_ID       : The Client Id of the service principal.
    - AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET   : The Client Secret value of the service principal.
    - AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID : The Azure Subscription ID.
    - AZURE_TENANT_ID       : The Azure Tenant ID.
    - AZURE_RMKEY           : Terraform state file name for each environment. (Eg: xxxxdev.tfstate).

### Variables.tf Secret Variables

  These variables are environment-specific. Define IP address space for VNets and Subnets, Azure AD Groups and Service Principal for RBAC, and environment and subscription acronyms for resource naming conventions in the secrets section.

     - Env               : Provide the name of the environment (for example, Dev or QA), which will be added to the resource naming convention.
     - Vnet-IP           : Provide the VNet Address Space
     - Subnet-IP         : Provide the Subnet Address Space
     - Subnet-Dsaddress1 : Provide the Delegated Subnet1 Address Space
     - Subnet-Dsaddress2 : Provide the Delegated Subnet2 Address Space
     - Subnet-Dsaddress3 : Provide the Delegated Subnet3 Address Space
     - subscription      : Provide the short form of the subscription name; this will be added to the resource naming convention.
     - Publisher-Name    : Provide the publisher name for API Management Resource.
     - Publisher-Email   : Provide the publisher email id for API Management Resource.
     - ADgroup1          : Provide the name of the Azure AD Group for contributor access to the App Resource Group (Admin Group).
     - ADgroup2          : Provide the name of the Azure AD Group for contributor access to the App Resource Group (DevelopmentTeam_Group).
     - ADgroup3          : Provide the name of the Azure AD Group for Reader access on App & Core Resource Groups.
     - Serviceprincipal  : Provide the name of the Service principal that was created for the Git connection; it will provide key vault secret user access and access policies for secrets on Key Vault for the Service Principal.

## Deployment Actions

The folder .github/workflows contains the GitHub Actions yaml script (main.yml) for deploying the Terraform IaC code on Microsoft Azure Platform.

### main.yml

The yaml file is a multi-job script that will perform security checks on IaC code as well as the deployment of resources to the target environment on Microsoft Azure Platform.

- **Step 1 :** Go to GitHub Actions and under the list of workflows click on CI
- **Step 2 :** In this workflow click Run Workflow to trigger the Deployment Action
- **Step 3 :** Once the workflow completes successfully, refer to the **[DDF SDR Azure Platform Setup and Deployment Guide](https://github.com/transcelerate/ddf-sdr-platform/raw/main/documents/ddf-sdr-azure-platform-setup-and-deployment-guide-v3.0.pdf)** for additional manual configuration updates to the deployed resources and further deploy SDR Reference Implementation (RI) Application Code

**Important Note :** GitHub Actions does not allow multi-environment deployment setup with Free Pricing Plan. To Deploy to different environments, the GitHub secret values have to be updated with values of the target Azure Environment.
