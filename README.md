- This file contains the resource configuration code. This file invokes the modules for the specific resources to be deployed on the Azure Cloud Platform.
- Single module can be called multiple times to create the same set of resources with different naming conventions and configurations.

## Variables.tf

- Variables that are repeated / parameterized / environment specific, are declared in variables.tf.

# Deployment Process

**Important Note:** Refer to the **[DDF SDR Azure Platform Setup and Deployment Guide](documents/ddf-sdr-azure-platform-setup-and-deployment-guide-v3.0.pdf) document for setting up a running instance of SDR on your own Azure Cloud Subscription. Additionally, below instructional videos provide a step-by-step run of the setup. 

Below videos guide user to create a new instance of the SDR in their local Azure Cloud Subscription.

    - AZURE_TENANT_ID       : The Azure Tenant ID.
    - AZURE_RMKEY           : Terraform state file name for each environment. (Eg: xxxxdev.tfstate).

### Variables.tf Secret Variables

  These variables are environment-specific. Define IP address space for VNets and Subnets, Azure AD Groups and Service Principal for RBAC, and environment and subscription acronyms for resource naming conventions in the secrets section.

     - ENV               : Provide the name of the environment (for example, Dev or QA), which will be added to the resource naming convention.
     - VNET-IP           : Provide the VNet Address Space
     - SUBNET-IP         : Provide the Subnet Address Space
     - SUBNET_DSADDRESS1 : Provide the Delegated Subnet1 Address Space
     - SUBNET_DSADDRESS2 : Provide the Delegated Subnet2 Address Space

## Deployment Actions

The folder .github/workflows contains the GitHub Actions yaml script (main.yml) for deploying the Terraform IaC code on Azure Cloud Platform. 

### main.yml

The yaml file is a multi-job script that will perform security checks on IaC code as well as the deployment of resources to the target environment on Azure Cloud Platform. Below tasks are in the main.yml file.

  **name: Terraform Install**
  - task will install the terraform and it's dependencies on hosted agents to deploy the resources
    - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
    - with:
        - terraform_version: 0.14.11
         
  **name: Terraform Init**
  - initializes the terrafrom configuration files
    - run:  terraform init -backend-config="storage_account_name=$STORAGE_ACCOUNT"    -backend-config="container_name=$CONTAINER_NAME" -backend-config="resource_group_name=$RESOURCE_GROUP"  -backend-config="key=$Blob_Key" 
      
  **name: Terraform Plan**
  - task creates an execution plan which lets us to review the changes made to the environment before applying the changes
    - run: terraform plan
           
  **name: Terraform Apply**
  - task execute the actions proposed in the terraform plan
    - run: terraform apply -auto-approve
### Running GitHub Workflows
- **Step 1 :** Go to GitHub Actions and under the list of workflows click on CI.
- **Step 2 :** In this workflow click Run Workflow to trigger the Deployment Action.
- **Step 3 :** Once the workflow completes successfully, refer to the **[DDF SDR Azure Platform Setup and Deployment Guide](https://github.com/transcelerate/ddf-sdr-platform/raw/main/documents/ddf-sdr-azure-platform-setup-and-deployment-guide-v3.0.pdf)** for additional manual configuration updates to the deployed resources and further deploy SDR Reference Implementation (RI) Application Code.

**Important Note :** GitHub Actions does not allow multi-environment deployment setup with Free Pricing Plan. To Deploy to different environments, the GitHub secret values have to be updated with values of the target Azure Environment.

# Infrastructure Changes for Release V2.0 (March 2023)

- The steps required to migrate SDR infrastructure from Version 0.5 to Version 2.0 for users who have set up their own SDR instance for the Study Definition Repository â€“ Reference Implementation on Azure Cloud Platform. It provides details for deploying the new resources using azure portal. Additionally, it provides details of containerized deployment for the SDR API and UI applications.

**Important Note:** Refer to the **[DDF SDR Infra Migration Guide (Release V2.0)](documents/DDF_SDR_Infra-Migration-guide (Release V2.0.pdf))** for upgrading to SDR Release V2.0.
